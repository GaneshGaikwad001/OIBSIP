          <b> <u>Early career in the 1940s</u> </b><br>
           <br>
          In 1942, when Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease.Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki),
         the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He
         helped her get started in a career as a singer and actress.She sang the song "Naachu Yaa Gade, Khelu Saari Mani
          Haus Bhaari", which was composed by Sadashivrao Nevrekar for Vasant Joglekar's Marathi movie Kiti Hasaal (1942)
           but the song was dropped from the final cut. Vinayak gave her a small role in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi 
        movie Pahili Mangalaa-gaur (1942), in which she sang "Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai" which was composed by Dada 
        Chandekar. Her first Hindi song was "Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu" for the Marathi film Gajaabhaau 
        (1943). The Bollywood industry was yet to find its feet, so Mangeshkar had to first concentrate on acting,
         which she didn't like, as the lights and people ordering her around made her feel uncomfortable.She moved to 
         Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessons in 
         Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhindibazaar Gharana.She sang "Paa Lagoon Kar Jori" for
        Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie Aap Ki Seva Mein (1946),which was composed by Datta Davjekar.
        The dance in the film was performed by Rohini Bhate, who later became a famous classical dancer.Lata and her
        sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak's first Hindi-language movie, Badi Maa (1945). In that movie, Lata
        also sang a bhajan, "Maata Tere Charnon Mein." She was introduced to music director Vasant Desai during the
         recording of Vinayak's second Hindi-language movie, Subhadra (1946).
        After Vinayak's death in 1948, music director Ghulam Haider mentored her as a singer. He introduced her to
        producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was then working on the movie Shaheed (1948), but Mukherjee dismissed her 
        voice as "too thin". An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years producers and directors would "fall
         at Lata's feet" and "beg her" to sing in their movies. Haider gave her her first major break with the song 
         "Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora"—lyrics by Nazim Panipati—in the movie Majboor (1948), which became 
         her first big breakthrough film hit. In an interview on her 84th birthday in 2013, she declared "Ghulam Haider 
         is truly my Godfather. He was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent."
